# Ziv-Lempel-Compression-and-Decompression
implementation of Ziv-Lempel compression and decompression algorithms in C++ utilizing binary search tree

You need to change the source file in Visual Studio to switch between the compression and decompression algorithms.

The compression algorithm takes "compin"(not compin.txt) as its input and compresses it to produce the file "compout". It also outputs the compressed number sequence to the console.

The decompression algorithm takes "compout"(not compout.txt) which is the file produced by the compression algorithm as its input and decompresses it to produce the file "decompout". It also outputs the decompressed text to the console. The contents of "compin" and "decompout" are always the same.
